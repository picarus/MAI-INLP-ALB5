Jacob Bernoulli, a noted Swiss mathematician, died in 1705, eight years before his essay on the theory of probability was published.

This treatise called the Ars Conjectandi is more commonly known as The Law of Large Numbers. Today, this Law of Large Numbers is still of the highest usefulness in it's theories of probabilities and it's applications to insurance, statistics and the mathematical study of heredity. In Las Vegas and other places where gambling exists, it is why "the odds are always in favor of the house." That slight edge is all they need.

Bernoulli went to great lengths to mathematically prove his theory of probability. His calculations fill a book. However, at the time, the world did not understand what Bernoulli had accomplished. It took Leonard Euler, known as "the most prolific mathematician in history", to understand Bernoulli's theory of probability well enough that he could explain it to the world. Of course, around the same time not many people understood Newton's Law of Gravity either! Now we teach it in third grade! This law is a part of our math books.

It has been written that the theory of probability is nothing more than good common sense reduced to mathematics. It has also been written, that many people play smart with an instinct, usually without being able to account for it. When it comes to the principles involved, you will simply learn how to use your own good common sense. You'll be able to play smart, and, now, you'll even be able to account for it! As you will see, lotteries are classic examples of The Law of Large Numbers at work.
